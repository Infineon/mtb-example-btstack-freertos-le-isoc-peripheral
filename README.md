# AIROC&trade; CYW20829: Bluetooth&reg; Low Energy Isochronous Peripheral

The following two examples, when executed in parallel on two separate boards, demonstrate the use of Bluetooth&reg; Low Energy isochronous channels with Infineon AIROC&trade; CYW20829 Bluetooth&reg; devices.

1. **LE Isochronous peripheral application:** This code example (this document) is designed to connect to an isochronous channel central application. When powered up and after pressing the USER BTN1 button, it starts advertising for the central to connect to it and establish an isochronous channel connection.

2. **LE Isochronous central application:** This complementary application implements the Central role. When powered up and after pressing the USER BTN1 button, it scans for the isochronous peripheral advertisements and connects to the peripheral when found and establishes an isochronous channel connection.

These code examples working together demonstrate the implementation of sending generic data over isochronous channels. The central application can also support two Connected Isochronous Streams (CIS), i.e., two isochronous connections to two separate peripheral devices.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example clones the "[LE ISOC Central](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btstack-freertos-le-isoc-central)" application with the desired name "le-isoc-central" configured for the *CYW920829M2EVK-02* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CYW920829M2EVK-02 --app-id mtb-example-btstack-freertos-le-isoc-central --user-app-name le-isoc-central --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).


To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br>

The following example adds the CYW920829M2EVK-02 BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   ~/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/library-manager/library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/le-isoc-central" --add-bsp-name CYW920829M2EVK-02 --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   ~/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/library-manager/library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/le-isoc-central" --set-active-bsp APP_CYW920829M2EVK-02
   ```

</details>

## Operation

### Single Connected Isochronous Stream (CIS) configuration (default)

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 3,000,000 baud.

3. Program the LE ISOC central and LE ISOC peripheral code examples onto two separate CYW920829M2EVK-02 boards using one of the following options:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

      a. Select the application project in Project Explorer.

      b. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. Reset both central and peripheral boards.

   a. Press **BTN1** on the central to start scanning.

   b. Press **BTN1** on the peripheral to start advertising.

   c. An LE connection should automatically be established. Verify that LED1 on both boards are glowing.

   d. After the LE connection is up, the central will automatically establish an isochronous channel.

5. Press **BTN1** at the *peripheral* side to send data to the central.

   LED2 glowing indicates that ISOC is established; therefore, the data is sent via ISOC. When the central receives the data, it toggles the LED2 state.

6. Press **BTN1** at the *central* side to send data to the peripheral.

   LED2 glowing indicates that ISOC is established; therefore, the data is sent via ISOC. When the peripheral receives the data, it toggles the LED2 state.

   Isochronous channel statistics are printed every 5s. In an ideal environment, the isoc_tx_count on the local side should match the isoc_rx_count on the peer side.

### MAX_CONNECTED_DEVICES compiler option (CIS configuration parameter)

This parameter defines the number of peripherals and CIS channels to support (default is '1'). Do the following to exercise the two CIS configurations.

1. In the application Makefile, set `MAX_CONNECTED_DEVICES?=2`.

2. Program the *LE ISOC central* code example onto a CYW920829M2EVK-02 board.

3. Program the *LE ISOC peripheral* code example onto two additional CYW920829M2EVK-02 boards. Be sure to update the PERIPHERAL_ID in the le-isoc-peripheral application makefile to 1 or 2 to differentiate the Bluetooth&reg; device addresses between the two peripherals.

4. Power up both central and one of the peripheral boards.

   a. Press **BTN1** on the central to start scanning.

   b. Press **BTN1** on one of the peripherals to start advertising.

   c. An LE connection should be established automatically. Verify that LED1 on both boards are glowing.

5. Pair a second device.

   a. Press **BTN1** on the central to start scanning for the 2nd device.

   b. Press **BTN1** on the 2nd peripheral to start advertising.

   c. An LE connection should be established automatically. Verify that LED1 on the second device side is glowing, indicating that the LE connection is automatically established.

   d. After the LE connections are up for all peripherals, the central will establish isochronous channels to both peripherals. LED2 on all three boards should be glowing.

6. Press **BTN1** on either *peripheral* side to send data to the central.

   LED2 glowing indicates that ISOC is established; therefore, the data is sent via ISOC. When the central receives the data, it toggles the LED2 state.

7. Press **BTN1** at the *central* side to send data to both peripherals.

   LED2 glowing indicates that ISOC is established; therefore, the data is sent via ISOC. When the peripherals receives the data, it toggles the LED2 state.

   Isochronous channel statistics are printed every 5s. Central side has seperate isoc_tx_count and isoc_rx_count for each peripheral. In an ideal environment, the isoc_tx_count[i] on the central side should equal to the isoc_rx_count of the peripheral[i] device. The isoc_rx_count[i] on the central side should equal to the isoc_tx_count of the peripheral[i] device.

**Be Noticed** - to be simple, when a CIS connection is lost, you need to reset all the boards to start over. CIS connection recovery is not implemented yet.

## Steps to enable BTSpy logs

**Note:** This feature is available only for CYW920829M2EVK-02.

1. Add airoc-hci-transport from library manager before enabling spy traces, check airoc-hci-transport [README.md](https://github.com/Infineon/airoc-hci-transport/blob/master/README.md) for more details. If airoc-hci-transport library is included in the application, it is recommended to initialize it (Call cybt_debug_uart_init()). If airoc-hci-transport library is present in the application, but you want to use retarget-io library to get application traces in Teraterm/putty, you need to set the ENABLE_AIROC_HCI_TRANSPORT_PRINTF MACRO value to 0 in the application. Otherwise printf messages of the application will not be visible.

#define ENABLE_AIROC_HCI_TRANSPORT_PRINTF 1

2. Navigate to the application Makefile and open it. Find the Makefile variable `ENABLE_SPY_TRACES` and set it to the value *1* as shown:
    ```
    ENABLE_SPY_TRACES = 1
    ```
3. Save the Makefile, and then build and program the application to the board.

4. Open the [ClientControl](https://github.com/Infineon/btsdk-host-apps-bt-ble/tree/master/client_control) application and make the following settings:
   - Set the baud rate to 3000000.
   - Deselect the flow control checkbox.
   - Select the serial port and click on an open port.
5. Launch the [BTSpy](https://github.com/Infineon/btsdk-utils/tree/master/BTSpy) tool.

6. Press and release the reset button on the board to get the BTSpy logs on the BTSpy tool.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


## Design and implementation

This code example demonstrates the use of Bluetooth&reg; Low Energy isochronous channels with Infineon AIROC&trade; CYW20829 Bluetooth&reg; devices to send generic data.

Bluetooth&reg; Low Energy isochronous channels were introduced in the Bluetooth&reg; Core Specification 5.2. Though highly touted as the pillar for new audio applications, isochronous channels can be used to send generic data and provides some advantages over traditional LE ACL connections. Since LE ACL connections can only support a minimum of 7.5ms and guarantees data delivery, it puts constraints on the amount of latency that can be supported. Given that LE isochronous channels are targeted towards time critical data delivery, it provides latency advantages and hence can open up opportunities for a broader range of applications.

The application uses a UART resource from the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to print debug messages on a UART terminal emulator. The UART resource initialization and retargeting of standard I/O to the UART port are done using the retarget-io library.

Upon reset, if the application was built with the `AUTO_PAIRING` macro defined, both the *peripheral* and *central* will initiate an LE connection. Once the LE connection is established, LED1 glows, and an isochronous channel is then established.

Note that when the LE connection is first connected, a connection interval of 30 ms is used that is able to balance between collisions with the isochronous channel setup vs the time it takes to set up the isochronous connection. That is, if the LE connection interval is smaller (7.5 ms, for example), there's a higher chance of collisions to occur when setting up isochronous channels, which can result in failure in setting up the isochronous channel establishment. On the other hand, if the LE connection interval is larger (1 second for example), there's a much less chance of collisions but the isochronous channel set up will take significantly longer because the LE connection is used for the setup procedure.

If the application was not built with the `AUTO_PAIRING` macro defined, pressing and releasing BTN1 on the *central* board will start scanning for a peripheral. Similarly, pressing and releasing BTN1 on the *peripheral* board will start advertisements. Once the peripheral is found, the *central* will create a LE connection and LED1 on both boards will glow once the link is up. Afterwards the *central* will establish an isochronous channel and LED2 on both boards will glow once the ISOC channel is up.

Pressing BTN1 at the *peripheral* side will cause a burst of data to be sent to the *central*. Similarly, Pressing BTN1 at the *central* side will cause a burst of data to be sent to the *peripheral*. Once the data is received on either side, the respective LED2 will be toggled indicating reception of data.


## Resources and settings

This section explains the ModusToolbox&trade; software resources and their configuration as used in this code example. Note that all the configuration explained in this section has already been done in the code example.

- **Device Configurator:** ModusToolbox&trade; stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the Device Configurator, which generates the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application's *GeneratedSource* folder.

   By default, all applications in a workspace share the same *design.modus* file - i.e., they share the same pin configuration. Each BSP has a default *design.modus* file in the *mtb_shared\TARGET_<bsp name>\<version>\COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* directory. It is not recommended to modify the configuration of a standard BSP directly.

   To modify the configuration for a single application or to create a custom BSP, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide). This example uses the default configuration. See the [Device Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** The Bluetooth&reg; peripheral has an additional configurator called the "Bluetooth&reg; Configurator" that is used to generate the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database and various Bluetooth&reg; settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*.

   Note that unlike the Device Configurator, the Bluetooth&reg; Configurator settings and files are local to each respective application. The services and characteristics added are explained in the [Design and implementation](#design-and-implementation) section. See the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig).

**Table 1. Application resources**

| Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose     |
| :------- | :------------    | :------------ |
| UART (HAL)|cy\_retarget\_io\_uart\_obj| UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for Debug UART port|
